# Project Three: Meteorite-Landings-Challenge

# Task
Build an interactive dashboard that demonstrate a thourough knowledge of data visualization.

# Background
The provided dataset revealed that a small handful of microbial species also called Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU's) in the study
were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

# Data Engineering
  1. JavaScript with D3.js
  2. Plotly library
  3. HTML
  4. MongoDB

  8. Python

# Data Visualization
This project visualizes meteorite landings around the world using data obtained from NASA's Meteorite Landings dataset. The data is used to generate multiple visualizations, including line charts tracking meteorite sightings over the years. The visualizations are served through a Flask-based API.

The Team designed two dashboards. One being a simple intearctive dashboard and the second. a dynamic interactive dashboard.
